# A Chinese Fortune-Telling Website

A group project at KU Leuven, I am in charge of a page that gives a person's lunar date of birth and Chinese zodiac sign when inputing his birth date in solar calendar. Also, it will calculate the weight of this person's life and provide a overview of his life based on the weight. The calculation is based on "Bone Weight Fortune-Telling (稱骨算命)" which was developed by a fortune teller in Tang dynasty called "TianGang Yuan (元天罡)".

Preview the website [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/dodopianist/Projects/blob/main/Fortune%20teller%20website/calculate.html).

Final Grade: 19/20.
