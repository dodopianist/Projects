# Showcasing the Early Publication World: Italy Archives (1501-1600)

An individual project at KU Leuven, for the course of "Introduction to Digital Humanities".

By using metadata from Italy archives (1500-1600) at KU Leuven, this report tries to recreate the publication world during that period. To achieve this goal, first, descriptive statistics are applied to know the data set better. Then, advanced analyses such as linear regression and network analysis are computed to investigate interesting phenomena that may reflect the real world in the past. Finally, the report reveals the adjustments of the original data set to compute the required analysis.
