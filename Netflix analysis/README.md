# Netflix Analysis for East Asian Producers

A group project at KU Leuven, for the course of "Data Visualisation".

Netflix is one of the most popular Western streaming platforms, with over 230M subscribers globally as of 2023. The success of K-dramas, which have gained immense popularity on the platform,highlighting the increasing recognition and demand for diverse content beyond traditional Western media offerings. Our visualization project aims to serve as a guide tailored to aid Asian producers in effectively promoting their work to Western platforms, allowing them to gain exposure and be appreciated by greater audiences.

In this project, I was in charge of coming up with our end user, conducting statistical analysis to find industry traits, building several graphes for our dashbroad and presenting in the final demo.

It is important to note that our [data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows) is limited to September 2021, and therefore we cannot account for any developments or changes that may have occurred after the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. However, we can provide insights into the impact during that period.
