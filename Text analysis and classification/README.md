# Text Analysis and Classification

An assignment to be done within 48 hrs for a Phd application. Sadly, I ended up did not get it.

The [first part](https://github.com/dodopianist/Projects/blob/main/Text%20analysis%20and%20classification/Task%202-1.ipynb) is to conduct text analysis on the dataset, I used word and bi-gram frequency and topic modeling. The [second part](https://github.com/dodopianist/Projects/blob/main/Text%20analysis%20and%20classification/Task%202-2.ipynb) is to classify the text of its potential effect on the environment with the score 0 (negative), 1 (neutral) and 2 (positive).

The copyright of the dataset belongs to the school I applied to, so they are not shown here.
