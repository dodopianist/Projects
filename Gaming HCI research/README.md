# The Relationship between Autonomy and Immersion Digital Games

A group project when I was studying at University of York, not at KU Leuven. I am in charge of designing and structuring our questionnaire via "Qualtrics", and conducting data analysis via R.

A lot of components of player experience in digital games were measured. However, they are mostly measured separately and only a few studies discuss the possible links between these components of player experience. Therefore, in this research, the relationship of two components of player experience, autonomy in immersion, are experimented. 30 participants are asked to play a digital game "Arena of Valour" in both autonomy and non-autonomy support condition to see the change of their immersion level.

The data can be found [here](https://github.com/dodopianist/Data_Analysis/blob/main/Gaming%20HCI%20research/Group%202%20Data.csv), and there is also an [easy-reading version](https://dodopianist.wixsite.com/chinghankuo/ux-research-project-digital-games) of our result.

Final Grade: 72/100.
