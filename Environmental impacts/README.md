# Classifying a Text's Environmental Impact

An assignment to be done within 48 hrs for a Phd application. Sadly, I ended up did not get it.

The [first part](https://github.com/dodopianist/Projects/blob/main/Environmental%20impacts/Task%202-1.ipynb) is to conduct text analysis on the dataset about descriptions of environmental impacts, I conducted it with word and bi-gram frequency, topic modeling and sentiment analysis. The [second part](https://github.com/dodopianist/Projects/blob/main/Environmental%20impacts/Task%202-2.ipynb) is to classify the text of its potential effect on the environment with the score 0 (negative), 1 (neutral) and 2 (positive). I used Bag of Words, Doc2Vec and the results of sentiment analysis as features, and applied logistic regression and decision tress for prediction.

The copyright of the dataset belongs to the school I applied for, so they are not shown here.
